### Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to model car prices. The dataset includes various features such as car company, fuel type, engine type, and dimensions of the cars. The goal is to preprocess this data, perform exploratory data analysis, and build a robust Linear Regression model to predict car prices.

****

### Data Description

The dataset `CarPrice_Assignment.csv` includes the following features:

- `CarName`: Name of the car
- `symboling`: Insurance risk rating
- `fueltype`: Fuel type (gas or diesel)
- `aspiration`: Type of aspiration (std or turbo)
- `carbody`: Type of car body (convertible, hatchback, etc.)
- `doornumber`: Number of doors
- `enginelocation`: Location of the engine (front or rear)
- `enginetype`: Type of engine (dohc, ohc, etc.)
- `cylindernumber`: Number of cylinders
- `fuelsystem`: Fuel system type
- `price`: Price of the car
- `carlength`, `carwidth`, `carheight`, `curbweight`, `enginesize`, `boreratio`, `horsepower`, `citympg`, `highwaympg`: Various car specifications

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Basic Statistical Analysis**: 
   - Overview of dataset structure and statistics.
   - Distribution of car prices and identifying outliers.

2. **Categorical Data Analysis**: 
   - Visualization of the distribution of car types, fuel types, and company names.
   - Analysis of average prices by company, fuel type, and car body type.

3. **Numerical Data Analysis**:
   - Scatter plots and correlation analysis between numerical features and car price.

****

### Feature Engineering

1. **Feature Creation**:
   - Derived new features like `fueleconomy` based on city and highway MPG.
   - Binned car prices into categories for better model understanding.

2. **Categorical Encoding**:
   - Converted categorical features into dummy variables for model compatibility.

****

### Model Building

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
   - Scaling numerical features using MinMaxScaler.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Built an initial Linear Regression model using statsmodels and performed feature selection using RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination).
   - Refined the model by removing multicollinear features and re-evaluating performance.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model based on various performance metrics and statistical summaries.

****

### Results

- The final model demonstrates effective prediction capabilities for car prices based on the selected features.
- Detailed statistical summaries and model performance metrics are provided in the analysis.
